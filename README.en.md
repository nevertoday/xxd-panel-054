<a href="README.md">简体中文</a> SELECTIVE MEMORY · MAIN VISUAL · SIX STICKERS · MATTE PRINT · AIRY BLUE

Compress the photograph into one narrative main visual and exactly six memory stickers with unequal scale and rank. Matte gouache, cut paper, Risograph, and screen-print texture turn it into a quiet independent-publishing collection page rather than an icon catalogue.

## Why this Skill exists

The style is source-dependent, not a decorative preset. Its operative transformation is:

```text
lock identity, silhouette, posture, and relation → preserve three cues → compress into three to six large shapes → build one main visual → select exactly six source-specific fragments → vary sticker scale, angle, overlap, and hierarchy → unify matte gouache and print texture → retain airy blue whitespace → add minimal copy
```

If an unrelated photograph could replace the source without materially changing the main visual, six fragments, shapes, hierarchy, colour, spacing, and copy, the result does not belong to this Panel.

## The visual contract

- Preserve at least three source-specific cues across silhouette, proportion, posture, action, structure, colour, material, or relation.
- Build one visibly dominant main visual from three to six large shapes, then select exactly six source-supported memory fragments.
- Make the six stickers unequal in scale and rank, arranging them asymmetrically with rotation, overlap, or edge escape; never form a catalogue, six-grid, or equal icon set.
- Give main visual and stickers one matte gouache, cut-paper, Risograph, or screen-print language, led by airy blues, pale neutrals, and tiny muted-blush accents.
- Maintain one focal point through scale contrast, positive-negative shape, overlap, and ample quiet ground.

Aesthetic constraints and rejection rules live only in the [original source brief](references/054-source.md); the Skill and runtime adapter handle delivery variables only. [Skill workflow](SKILL.md) · [English runtime adapter](references/xxd-panel-054-prompt.en.md)

These samples demonstrate the 054 aesthetic motive. Their subjects, composition, palette, copy, and earlier canvas ratio never become generation references or current defaults.

## The original brief is authoritative

`references/054-source.md` is this project's sole creative and aesthetic authority. The Skill no longer summarizes or expands it, and it does not impose a shared palette, colour plan, aesthetic motive, title, or microcopy package. GPT Image 2 follows that brief's own rules for colour, material, composition, whitespace, wording, and typography.

Mode and size change only the legacy 3:4 top-bottom container. In left-right mode, the brief's upper photo and lower design map to the left and right. In design-only and wallpaper modes, the lower design language expands across the whole canvas. Every other source-brief instruction remains active.

## Four combinable output modes

Select one or more of `top-bottom`, `left-right`, `design-only`, and `wallpaper-pack`. Paired work is generated as one complete canvas by default; deterministic composition is only a fallback after a failed retry, for pixel-identical source preservation, or for lossless size calibration.

Ordinary sizes are also multi-select: auto-fit, source aspect, 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9, 5:7, 7:5, or custom ratios/exact pixels. There is no silent default. Every distinct aspect is independently recomposed from the same verbatim source brief.

Wallpaper packs may be linked or independent. A linked pack creates one anchor image, then recomposes each remaining device from the original source plus that anchor; it never crops one image into four sizes.

## Text modes

Before generation, resolve one of three choices:

1. **Model generates text from the original prompt**: the user supplies only the language or locale; GPT Image 2 follows the source brief's own wording, amount, tone, and typography logic.
2. **Use my exact text**: pass it verbatim, without rewriting, translating, or adding a title; typography still follows the source brief.
3. **No text**: prohibit visible text and pseudo-text.

The outer Skill no longer pre-writes titles, microcopy, or copy packages. Output language is resolved separately from the interface language and is never guessed from a person, scene, or filename.

## Complete-canvas first, raster-only delivery

The image model owns the aesthetics of the entire finished composition; paired layouts also default to one complete-canvas generation. `scripts/compose_panel.py` remains only for condition-based recovery, lossless pixel calibration, and read-only audit. It is not run pre-emptively and does not judge aesthetic success.

Every deliverable is a raster PNG and every invocation creates a fresh task under `~/Desktop/xxd/`. The configured image route exposes sanitised status only—never providers, endpoints, credentials, headers, prompts, responses, or account details. SVG, HTML, Canvas, diagrams, and programmatic drawing are not substitutes for the final artwork.

## Capability-adaptive questions and inline parameters

The same Skill adapts to the host's real interaction capabilities and never presents decorative symbols as clickable controls:

- **When Claude Code exposes `AskUserQuestion + multiSelect: true`**: modes and sizes use genuine checkboxes; text mode and wallpaper relationship use single-select. Common sizes are grouped into square, portrait, and landscape checkbox questions, selections accumulate across groups, and custom sizes use free input.
- **When Codex exposes only `request_user_input`**: use it only for mutually exclusive fields such as text mode and wallpaper relationship. Do not misrepresent modes or sizes as single-choice; collect them through clear combination input.
- **With no interactive question tool**: use two typed rounds—modes first, then sizes plus text. Never draw fake `- [ ]` boxes or ask the user to switch to Plan mode merely to obtain a form.

The second round initially shows only Smart recommendation, Source aspect, Common ratios, and Custom. Expand the full library only when requested: square `1:1`; portrait `3:4, 4:5, 2:3, 9:16, 5:7`; landscape `4:3, 5:4, 3:2, 16:9, 21:9, 7:5`. Any ratios may be combined, and exact pixels are always accepted.

All settings can also be passed inline:

```text
/xxd-panel-054 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom,design-only --size auto,3:4,9:16 --text prompt --locale ja-JP
```

Supported parameters are `--mode`, repeatable or comma-separated `--size`, `--text prompt|exact|none`, `--locale`, `--copy`, `--wallpaper linked|independent`, `--wallpaper-size`, and `--out`. Complete parameters skip preflight; partial parameters trigger only missing questions.

## Image-model priority

GPT Image 2 is the default first choice. It keeps this project's established workflow: high-fidelity source reference, explicit whole-canvas selection before generation, one complete-canvas generation for paired modes, and scripted composition only as a conditional fallback.

Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model may also be used when it is actually available through the current tools or configured routes and can satisfy source fidelity, whole-canvas ratio, target-language text, and linked-wallpaper multi-reference requirements. An alternative changes only the generation route; it must not change modes, canvas, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or the complete-canvas-first strategy.

If no suitable route is available, the Skill asks the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task without being echoed, displayed, logged, or exposed. They are not persisted, and provider, account, billing, or global route configuration is not modified, unless the user explicitly requests that configuration change.

## Get started

mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/xxd-panel-054" ~/.codex/skills/xxd-panel-054

Claude Code users may link the same folder under `~/.claude/skills/xxd-panel-054`. Restart the agent session after installation.

```text
$xxd-panel-054
Use this photograph, ask me for the modes and copy setting, then generate fresh raster outputs.
```
